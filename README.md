## RayWeather

This project is based on the All Weather Portfolio of Ray Dalio.
It is adapted to be used in Europe. 

I'm not a certified financial advisor so this is not financial advice! :D

## Pre-requisites

### Node version 16.20.0

```bash
nvm use 16.20.0
```


### A key for https://www.alphavantage.co/

Add in your environment variables


## Local Development

```bash
## prep steps for first time users
npm i -g netlify-cli # Make sure you have the [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli) installed
git clone https://github.com/netlify/create-react-app-lambda ## clone this repo
cd create-react-app-lambda ## change into this repo
yarn # install all dependencies

## done every time you start up this project
ntl dev ## nice shortcut for `netlify dev`, starts up create-react-app AND a local Node.js server for your Netlify functions
```

This fires up [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-CRAL&utm_campaign=devex#netlify-dev-beta), which:

- Detects that you are running a `create-react-app` project and runs the npm script that contains `react-scripts start`, which in this project is the `start` script
- Detects that you use `netlify-lambda` as a [function builder](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-dev-plugin/#function-builders-function-builder-detection-and-relationship-with-netlify-lambda), and runs the npm script that contains `netlify-lambda build`, which in this project is the `build:lambda` script.

You can view the project locally via Netlify Dev, via `localhost:8888`.

Each function will be available at the same port as well:

- `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/hello` and 
- `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/async-dadjoke`

## Deployment

During deployment, this project is configured, inside `netlify.toml` to run the build `command`: `yarn build`.

`yarn build` corresponds to the npm script `build`, which uses `npm-run-all` (aka `run-p`) to concurrently run `"build:app"` (aka `react-scripts build`) and `build:lambda` (aka `netlify-lambda build src/lambda`).
